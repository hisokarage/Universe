# Universe
Weather app is based on Dark Sky API.
https://darksky.net/dev/docs#overview

The current app has a trivial theme - weather and it is my first attempt for using MVVM architecture pattern (I hope that I understand it correclty). There were used FPR-framework called Bond. Bond is used to set up data persistence that we receive from the Internet and between screens from viewmodel.
